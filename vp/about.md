In my personal life, I'm a husband and father of two. My wife runs a
[fantastic blog](https://www.funathomewithkids.com/), and has written
[several books](https://www.amazon.com/Asia-Citro/e/B00KODFI6E) filled with
awesome activities and (more importantly!) pictures of our wee ones. In my
"copious spare time", I like rock climbing, hiking, and biking. 

## Work

![Work pic](/work_profile_pic.jpg)

On the professional side, I'm currently a Software Engineer at Google in
Seattle. I'm currently on the
[Colaboratory](https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/08/doing-data-science-with-colaboratory.html)
team, and I've worked on several projects here, including
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/),
[apitools](https://github.com/google/apitools), and
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

(Yes, that's actually my profile picture at work. I'm a terribly serious
person, as you can tell.)

Before starting at Google, I was a number theorist. I finished my PhD in 2009
at UCLA under [Haruzo Hida](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~hida), and soon I'll get
some papers and whatnot linked here.

## Projects

* Actually updating this webpage. Still in progress.

* I'm a maintainer of the [bigrquery](https://github.com/rstats-db/bigrquery)
  R package. 

* I'm writing an R package called
  [gauth](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gauth), with the goal of making auth
  for Google APIs less painful in R.

* I added support for R to [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/), first as
  [a shim at runtime](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis), and later as
  [an official language](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/r/)
  ([blog post](https://blog.travis-ci.com/2015-02-26-test-your-r-applications-on-travis-ci/)).

* I spent several years heavily involved with
  [Sage](https://www.sagemath.org/). I haven't had much time to write any code
  in Sage lately, but I did help William get
  [funding from Google Research](https://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2014/09/collaborative-mathematics-with.html)
  to fund SageMathCloud development.
